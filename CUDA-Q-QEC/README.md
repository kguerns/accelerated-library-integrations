# CUDA-Q QEC

[CUDA-Q QEC](https://nvidia.github.io/cudaqx/components/qec/introduction.html)
is the quantum error-correction library in CUDA-QX. It provides Python and C++
tools for error-correcting codes, stabilizer measurements, detector error
models, and syndrome decoders.

This project uses CUDA-Q QEC for one workflow: estimating logical error rates.

1. Choose a code.
2. Add physical errors or circuit-level noise.
3. Measure or compute a syndrome.
4. Decode the syndrome.
5. Compare logical errors before and after decoding.

The presentation flow is:

1. **Hello QEC:** the Steane demo shows the smallest complete QEC loop.
2. **Realistic QEC:** the surface-code memory demo adds repeated syndrome
   rounds and circuit-level noise.
3. **Why GPUs matter:** the CPU/GPU syndrome benchmark and decoder
   time/accuracy benchmark show throughput and accuracy tradeoffs for repeated
   QEC work.

## Purpose & Prerequisites

Physical qubits are noisy. Quantum error correction protects a logical qubit by
encoding it across multiple physical qubits, measuring stabilizers, and using a
classical decoder to infer a correction.

CUDA-Q QEC is useful for teams that want to:

- test QEC codes before fault-tolerant hardware is available
- compare decoders and noise assumptions
- estimate logical error rates
- study GPU-accelerated syndrome decoding

This project is intended to run on a Brev L4 instance. The required packages
are listed in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt).

## Installation & Basic Functionality

Use [`examples/SETUP.md`](./examples/SETUP.md) for setup and run commands. The
basic flow is:

1. Check the GPU with `nvidia-smi`.
2. Install the Python requirements.
3. Run `examples/run_project.py`.
4. Use the generated CSVs, plots, and summary in [`results/`](./results).

Included examples:

- `examples/run_project.py` runs the standard project workflow with default
  Brev L4 settings, including the Steane demo, surface-code demos, GPU
  throughput checks, plots, and summary.
- `examples/install_verification.py` checks imports, Steane code access, and a
  tiny `single_error_lut` decode.
- `examples/hello_syndrome.py` sweeps physical bit-flip probability for the
  Steane code and reports raw vs decoded logical error rates.
- `examples/surface_memory.py` runs one surface-code memory experiment with
  circuit-level noise.
- `examples/surface_sweep.py` creates LUT and QLDPC surface-code logical
  error-rate sweep CSVs with fixed syndrome rounds by default.
- `examples/cpu_gpu_benchmark.py` compares CPU NumPy and GPU CuPy throughput
  for the same batched QEC syndrome calculation.
- `examples/decoder_benchmark.py` compares LUT and QLDPC BP=0 at `d=7` by
  default, with an optional distance sweep.
- `examples/plot_results.py` creates combined presentation plots and
  `results/SUMMARY.md` from CSV outputs.

## Relevant Use Case

**Logical error-rate estimation for quantum hardware and software teams**

A quantum hardware company, quantum software platform, HPC center, or research
lab may want to evaluate whether a code and decoder combination can protect a
logical qubit well enough for future workloads. CUDA-Q QEC fits into that
workflow by connecting noise modeling, syndrome sampling, decoding, and logical
error-rate measurement.

This connects to AIPS:

- **Accelerate:** compare CPU and GPU-style throughput plus QEC decoder
  time/accuracy tradeoffs on Brev L4.
- **Integrate:** add QEC experiments to an existing CUDA-Q Python or C++
  workflow.
- **Promote:** show logical error-rate plots and decoder-throughput results
  from Brev L4.
- **Sell:** explain why NVIDIA GPUs matter before large-scale fault-tolerant
  QPUs are widely available.
